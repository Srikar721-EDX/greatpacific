This project addresses the damage that humans create by dumping plastic that eventually ends up in the oceans. I specifically used the Great Pacific Garbage Patch as an example, since it is one of biggest evidences/signs of ocean pollution occurring. The goal of this website is for you to realize all the damages caused by just throwing away plastic anywhere we choose to and convince you to be on the side of the solution to the this problem.
